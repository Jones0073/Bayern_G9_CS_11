# Introduction

## First Things First
This folder contains an introduction to java and python in general. 
It will cover everything you learned about java in the last years, and will hopefully help you to remember everything.<hr>
<strong> This is not a complete guide to java or python. It's just a reminder of what you learned in the last years. </strong><hr>
You can also find some python examples here, to get a first impression of the language. 
(It's really easy, I promise. You can read it like plain english)

## Structure
The folder is divided into two subfolders: [`java`](java/README.md) and [`python`](python/README.md).
Each of them contains a README.md file with the basics of the language.
They also contain some examples and exercises to get you started.<br>
The examples are the same in both languages, so you can compare them and see the differences and similarities.<br>
This Structure is universal for all topics in this repository.

## Roadmap
This roadmap will show you when to learn what. Of course this can vary depending on the teacher <hr>
- [ ] Work through the [java Readme](java/README.md) and see what you remember
- [ ] Take a look at the [python](python/README.md) folder and see where you can find similarities and differences.
- [ ] Try to write some code in both languages. You can use the examples in this folder as a starting point.
- [ ] Take a look at the [recursion](../recursion/README.md) module
